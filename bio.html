  <h1>About Kip Connell</h1>

  <p>I’m Kip Connell, a dedicated husband and proud father of two incredible special needs sons. I currently serve as an Intern at SOFWERX, supporting systems administration and IT operations, and work as a Firefighter Paramedic and Driver Engineer with Pasco County Fire Rescue.</p>

  <p>Before entering public service, I served seven years in the U.S. Army, leaving with the rank of Sergeant. My final assignment was as an Infantry Squad Leader in a dismounted unit responsible for personal security detachments, Quick Reaction Force operations, and patrols. During my service, I was awarded three Army Commendation Medals, including one with Valor for actions during operations in Afghanistan.</p>

  <p>I earned a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity from Saint Leo University, graduating cum laude. While there, I served as the inaugural President of the Upsilon Pi Epsilon International Honor Society for the Computer Sciences and was honored with the Dean’s Award for Excellence, having been nominated by faculty to represent the CARDs College (Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Data Science).</p>

  <p>My career reflects a lifelong dedication to service, whether protecting communities, securing systems, or caring for my family.</p>
